**Polymarker** is an automated bioinformatics pipeline for SNP assay development which increases the probability of generating homoeologue-specific assays for polyploid wheat.
Please see http://polymarker.tgac.ac.uk/, http://polymarker.tgac.ac.uk/Markdown?md=About and https://github.com/TGAC/bioruby-polyploid-tools for further instructions.

Before using ```polymarker.rb``` you have to ```source ../.bashrc``` from the working directory.
